			<h2>Challenge</h2>

			<p>Our company was losing money by having a third party print and send reimbursement forms. Our Customer Service Representatives needed to be able to send participants forms at a participants request. Previously when participants called in to ask for a form our reps had to do a three way call to the third party that handled the forms. By hosting forms on our end, participants saved time and the company saved money on printing and processing costs.</p>

			<h2>Process</h2>

			<div class="greyContainer">
				<p>To kick the project off, I went to our call center and observed the Customer Service Reps taking calls about funding. Even though they didn't have access to the forms, the reps were able to access a lot of a participants information using our call center software. I wanted to see what part of the software they used the most when dealing with funding questions and what mental models they had about it. This helped me decide where the new forms section would best fit into their current workflow. After observation, I began a process of creating sketches, going back and getting feedback from the Customer Service Reps, and then iterating again. I really enjoyed working so closely with our users and having their feedback through each step of the process.</p>
